# isaac-save-viewer

This is the source code for the [Isaac Save Viewer](https://zamiell.github.io/isaac-save-viewer/), a tool to view save completion status for *[The Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/)*.

It is written using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling, and uses [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) for CSS. The achievement images are taken from the [Isaac wiki](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/Binding_of_Isaac:_Rebirth_Wiki). The "items.json" file and collectible images are taken from the [Rebirth Item Tracker](https://github.com/Rchardon/RebirthItemTracker).
